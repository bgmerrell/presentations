* Goal of this talk

Understand Go well enough to reason about when and where to use it

* History

- Appeared in 2009 (with 1.0 being released March 2012)

- Ken Thompson (Unix, B), Rob Pike (Plan 9), Robert Griesemer (Java HotSpot VM)

- Wanted to build a language that is efficient, safe, and easy to use

- Doing research into programming language design was not the purpose

* Justification -- Why another language?

C++ is too complex

Compilation is too slow

"Programming had become too difficult"

Many programmers were choosing ease over safety and efficiency

The computing landscape and scale has changed

* Adoption

Several Go programs in production inside Google

Being used for distributed systems and concurrency University courses (MIT, Carnegie Mellon)

GopherCon 2014

Go is rapidly closing in on 1% of total commits and half a percent of projects and contributors (compared to the most popular programming languages at ~10% and ~5% respectively).

Adoption by other companies...

* Companies at Gophercon using Go

- Canonical (Juju orchestration tool)
- PayPal (Beacon)
- Puppet Labs
- Mozilla (Heka)
- SoundCloud
- The Hybrid Group (Gobot.io)
- GitHub (traffic graphs)
- stackoverflow
- Apcera
- MongoDB
- Poptip

And others.  Most are hiring Go programmers.

* Other companies hiring Go programmers:

- Adobe (Site reliability in Seattle)
- Hewlett-Packard (SE in Colorado)
- Thomson Reuters
- Intel
- Breitbart (?)

In Utah

- Rakuten MediaForge
- SpaceMonkey
- Steal Network

* Praise & Predictions

* Learning a new language

"Go is a new language. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs different in character from programs written in its relatives. A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go is unlikely to produce a satisfactory resultâ€”Java programs are written in Java, not Go. On the other hand, thinking about the problem from a Go perspective could produce a successful but quite different program. In other words, to write Go well, it's important to understand its properties and idioms. It's also important to know the established conventions for programming in Go, such as naming, formatting, program construction, and so on, so that programs you write will be easy for other Go programmers to understand."

Effective Go ([[http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html]])

* Go is...

Compiled (to machine code)

Strongly typed

Statically typed (with type inference)

Garbage collected

Similar to C in its syntax

Capable of statically verified duck typing (via interfaces)

Open Source

* Go does not have...

Classes

Exceptions

Assertions

Templates / generics (for now)

Operator overloading

Macros

* Hello World

.code intro-to-go/hello-world.go

* Variable declarations

.play intro-to-go/variable-declarations.go

* Functions

.code intro-to-go/functions.go

* Functions returning multiple values

.play intro-to-go/multiple-return-vals.go

* Basic types

.code intro-to-go/basic-types.txt

* Type conversions

No implicit conversions

.play intro-to-go/type-conversions.go

* Looping

.play intro-to-go/looping0.go

* More looping

.play intro-to-go/looping1.go

* Even more looping

.play intro-to-go/looping2.go

* If/else

.play intro-to-go/if-else.go

* Switch

.play intro-to-go/switch.go

* Switch with no condition

.play intro-to-go/switch-no-condition.go

* Structs (defining your own types)

.play intro-to-go/structs.go

* Don't fear Go pointers

.play intro-to-go/pointers.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Slices

.play intro-to-go/slices.go

* Range

.play intro-to-go/range.go

* Maps

.play intro-to-go/maps.go

* Function values and function literals

.play intro-to-go/func-vals-and-func-literals.go

* Functions vs. Methods

.image intro-to-go/img/fry-func-or-method.jpg

* Methods

.play intro-to-go/methods.go

* Methods continued

.play intro-to-go/methods-pointers.go

* Pointer Receivers vs. Value Receivers

If in doubt, use a pointer receiver (it will behave like a method in other modern languages)

*Specifics*

- A pointer receiver should be used to persist object modifications

- A pointer receiver should be used for large objects

- A value receiver can be used for small objects (but the thing about persistence still applies)

* Methods on any type

.play intro-to-go/methods-on-any-type.go

* Interfaces

.play intro-to-go/interfaces.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/


* Empty interfaces and variadic functions

.code intro-to-go/fmt-println.go

* Errors

.play intro-to-go/errors-simple.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Errors continued

.play intro-to-go/errors.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Concurrency

.play intro-to-go/concurrency.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Concurrency continued

.play intro-to-go/concurrency-for-with-select.go

* Utah Gophers
