* Goal of this talk

Understand Go well enough to reason about when and where to use it

* History

- Appeared in 2009 (with 1.0 being released March 2012)

- Ken Thompson (Unix, B), Rob Pike (Plan 9), Robert Griesemer (Java HotSpot VM)

- Wanted to build a language that is efficient, safe, and easy to use

- Doing research into programming language design was not the purpose

* Justification -- Why another language?

"Programming had become too difficult"

C++, Java: Too complex, hard to use, verbose.

Compilation is too slow

The computing landscape and scale has changed

Many programmers were choosing ease (i.e., Perlythonubyscript) over safety and efficiency

* Go is...

Compiled (to machine code)

Strongly typed

Statically typed (with type inference)

Garbage collected

Similar to C in its syntax

Capable of statically verified duck typing (via interfaces)

Open Source

* Go does not have...

Classes

Exceptions

Assertions

Templates / generics (for now)

Operator overloading

Macros

A set type

* Adoption

* Companies using Go

* Today's Language Landscape

- Following graphs taken from Brad Fitzpatrick's GoCon Tokyo talk: "Go: 90% Perfect, 100% of the time."
- Subjective, personal opinions
- It's often about trade-offs

* Fast & Fun

* Concurrency

* Statically Checked

* Learning a new language

"Go is a new language. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs different in character from programs written in its relatives. A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go is unlikely to produce a satisfactory resultâ€”Java programs are written in Java, not Go. On the other hand, thinking about the problem from a Go perspective could produce a successful but quite different program. In other words, to write Go well, it's important to understand its properties and idioms."

Effective Go ([[http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html]])

* Hello World

.code programming-in-go/hello-world.go

* Basic types

.code programming-in-go/basic-types.txt

* Variable declarations

.play programming-in-go/variable-declarations.go

* Looping, if/else, switch

TODO

* Structs (defining your own types)

.play programming-in-go/structs.go

* Don't fear Go pointers

.play programming-in-go/pointers.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Slices

.play programming-in-go/slices.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Range

.play programming-in-go/range.go

* Maps

.play programming-in-go/maps.go

* Function values and function literals

.play programming-in-go/func-vals-and-func-literals.go

* Methods

.play programming-in-go/methods.go

* Methods continued

.play programming-in-go/methods-pointers.go

* Pointer Receivers vs. Value Receivers

If in doubt, use a pointer receiver (it will behave like a method in other modern languages)

*Specifics*

- A pointer receiver should be used to persist object modifications

- A pointer receiver should be used for large objects

- A value receiver can be used for small objects (but the thing about persistence still applies)

* Methods on any type

.play programming-in-go/methods-on-any-type.go

* Embedding Structs

.play programming-in-go/struct-embedding.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Interfaces

.play programming-in-go/interfaces.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/


* Empty interfaces and variadic functions

.code programming-in-go/fmt-println.go

* Errors

.play programming-in-go/errors-simple.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Errors continued

.play programming-in-go/errors.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Concurrency

.play programming-in-go/concurrency.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Concurrency continued

.play programming-in-go/concurrency-for-with-select.go

* Great tooling
